## API access

In order to use Bruinen, you'll first need an account — you can apply from our docs or through the website.

Bruinen provides two options for API access:

* The easiest method is to use the [Bruinen SDK](/api-reference/bruinen-sdk), enabling you to access the API without having to interact directly with server code
* It is also possible to access Bruinen directly via API using the base URL `https://api.bruinen.co/`

Currently, Bruinen does not provide a sandbox environment — we recommend testing your integration using your own accounts!
Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference) a full list of available endpoints.

## Authentication

There are two methods of authentication with Bruinen: using an API key or a bearer token.

### API key (backend only)

API key authentication is intended only for use on a trusted server.

<Warning>
Do not ship your API key with frontend code
</Warning>

Place your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of any request to Bruinen.

```typescript
const client = axios.create({
    baseUrl: "https://api.bruinen.co/",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
});
```

### User access token (frontend)

A user access token is a bearer token that can also be passed to Bruinen for authentication.
This token is specific to a single user and client, and will only give you access to resources associated with that user.
A bearer token is appropriate to use in the frontend for an authenticated user.

This token can be generated via the `/auth/:userId` endpoint or using the SDK:

```typescript
const clientUserToken = bruinenSDK.getUserAuthToken(email);
```

To use the token once generated, place it in the header of your requests:

```typescript
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>
```

It is a JWT token and can be inspected using `jwt.io` to ensure that it has the proper claims.
The JWT will have a `sub` field with the user's ID, and a `clientId` field with your client ID.

## Step-by-step instructions

<Note>
This guide assumes use of the Bruinen SDK, but all steps can also be performed directly via API
</Note>

### 1. Install the SDK

To install the Bruinen SDK and instantiate the Bruinen API, follow the instructions on the Bruinen SDK reference.

### 2. Create a user

To begin requesting data from your users, you'll first need to create one in the Bruinen system:

```typescript
const user = bruinenSDK.findOrCreate(email);
```

Passing an email is required and allows Bruinen to look up the user on our end.
The `user` object returned will include an `id` field that can be used to request access to user accounts.

### 3. Request access to a source

Now that you have a user created, it's time to ask them permission to access their account(s) and establish the link.
The easiest way to request access is via [Bruinen Connect](/api-reference/bruinen-connect), our managed UI that you can embed in your app to enable users to directly add and authenticate their accounts.

If instead you'd like to provide a custom authentication experience, you can create a connection request directly:

```typescript
const { authUrl, accountId } = bruinenSDK.requestConnection(user.id, source, redirect);
```

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `redirect` | The link within your app where the user will be redirected once authentication is complete |
| `source`   | The source you are requesting access to                                                    |

When you request a connection to a source, you will either get back an `authUrl` or an `accountId`, depending on whether or not the user already has an active connection to the requested source. 

If the user has an active connection, an `accountId` will be returned and can be used immediately to access the source.

Otherwise, an `authUrl` will be returned — this is the URL that the user must visit to authenticate with the requested source and allow you to access their credentials. 
In your application you should present the `authUrl` to the user so they can navigate to it and complete authentication.

<Note>
For some sources, including non-public API sources (e.g., Amazon) and blockchain wallets (e.g., Ethereum) you must use Bruinen Connect and cannot use `requestConnection` directly.
</Note>

### 4. Pull data

At this point, you've requested a connection to a source and the user has authenticated their account.
From now on, all you need is the `accountId` to access that source.

First, you'll want to pull the user's account for the desired source (e.g., Twitter):

```typescript
const accounts = bruinenSDK.getAccounts(user.id);

const twitterAccount = _.first(accounts, (account) => {
    account.source === SourceType.twitter
});
```

Once you have the account for the requested source, you can pull data using the `id` and the specific methods of the source you've chosen:

```typescript
const twitterSource = bruinenSDK.twitter(twitterAccount.id);

const profile = twitterSource.getProfile();
```

Bruinen abstracts away the complexity of handling refresh tokens, scopes, permissions, rate limits, pagination, and other details — all you need to request data from a source is the user ID and your API key or bearer token.
