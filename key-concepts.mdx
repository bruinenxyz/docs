Bruinen's API revolves around three main concepts: users, sources, and accounts.

## Users

A [user](/api-reference/users) represents a single user's identity in Bruinen's system.

To create a user, pass the user's email as the primary key.
The user will then be associated with any existing user in Bruinen's system that has already been created with the same primary key.

## Sources

A [source](/api-reference/sources) represents an external company or API that holds valuable parts of a user's identity.
Example sources include Twitter, Amazon, and Github.

Under the hood, Bruinen establishes a connection to the sources that users have authenticated.
Once a source is connected, Bruinen will keep the connection current and manage the complexity of scopes, permissions, data validation, and data normalization.

The full list of supported and planned sources can be found [here](https://bruinen.co/sources).

## Accounts

An [account](/api-reference/accounts) represents a single external user account at a specific source (e.g., a user's Google or Facebook account).
A user can have multiple accounts across different sources, and even multiple accounts from the same source.

Users have full access to all of their accounts, while clients only have access to accounts that the user has granted them permission to access.
If more than one client requests access to an account for a given user, the existing connection will be reused, meaning your users will only ever have to establish a connection (i.e. sign into their account) a single time.
