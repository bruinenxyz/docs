description: "Integrate with Bruinen quickly and easily using our Javascript/Typescript SDK."
---

The Bruinen SDK makes it easy for developers to access the API without having to interact with server code directly.
The SDK is currently only available in Typescript.
It is available as both a browser script and a Node.js package.

All endpoints will be strongly typed with Typescript.

## Use in the backend with Node.js

First, install the [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bruinenxyz/bruinen-sdk):

```bash
npm install @bruinenxyz/bruinen-sdk

yarn add @bruinenxyz/bruinen-sdk
```

Once the SDK is installed, instantiate it:

```typescript
import Bruinen from "@bruinenxyz/bruinen-sdk";

const Bruinen = new Bruinen({
    type: "apiKey"
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
});
```

## Use in the browser

## Requesting user authentication

It is significantly easier to use our managed UI, Bruinen Connect, to request a user authenticate with a source.
However if you prefer to build your own custom UI, you can do so via the SDK.

<Warning>
  Without Bruinen Connect, users will not be able to reuse connections
  previously made with Bruinen, possibly adding additional steps for the user to
  complete authentication
</Warning>

```typescript
const user = await Bruinen.findOrCreateUser("test@test.com");
const connectionRequest = await Bruinen.connectionRequest(user.id, "github");
if (connectionRequest.status !== "accepted") {
  // Redirect the user to connectionRequest.authUrl
}

const userAccounts = await Bruinen.getAccounts(user.id);
const githubAccount = _.filter(
  userAccounts,
  (account) => account.source === "github"
);

// Now you have the user's Github account! If the user rejected the connectionrequest
// or there was another error, the connectionRequest.error field will be set on
// the connectionRequest you created.
```

## Requesting data

All sources available in the API reference are also available by name in the SDK.
To reach a specific source, use the methods defined for that source.
See below for an example connection to Github:

```typescript
// In your actual code you will need to pass authentication options
const bruinen = new Bruinen({});

// This object will have any Github source methods available
const github = bruinen.Github(githubAccount.id);

const profile = await github.getProfile();
```

All endpoints available on the sources are available via the SDK with `get` prepended to the path name.
For example: `/tweets => .getTweets()` and `/profile => .getProfile()`
