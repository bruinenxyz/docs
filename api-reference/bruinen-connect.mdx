Bruinen Connect is an in-site script used to manage user account authentication directly without the need for you to write any custom code.
Connect provides a managed UI to allow:

- You to request access to user accounts
- Users to grant permission for you to use data from already-authenticated sources
- Users to view and manage authenticated sources directly in your application

When using Bruinen Connect, you will not need to build a custom UI to handle account authentication or manage the complexities of redirecting users to source-specific authentication URLs.

## Setting up Connect

To install Bruinen Connect on a webpage, add the following tag to the bottom of your HTML body:

```html
<script src="https://bruinen-connect-script.onrender.com/browser.js" />
```

Once installed, you can initialize Connect:

```typescript
new window.BruinenConnect({
    userToken: string; // Required.
    clientID: string; // Required.
    sources: Array<Source>; // List of sources to link with
    currentUrl: string; // Required. The URL of the current page (including path)
    bruinenProfileUrl: "https://profile.bruinen.xyz";
    embedElementId: string; // Required. The ID of the HTML parent element for the Bruinen Connect iFrame.
});
```

On initialization, you must pass a `userToken`, which can be generated via the `/auth/:userId` endpoint or using the SDK:

```typescript
const userToken = bruinenSDK.getUserAuthToken(userId);
```

Note that this method can only be called using your secret and will fail if initiated from the browser-side SDK.

## Using Connect

```typescript
{
  // Removes the modal from the page
  function closeConnect(): void;
}
```
