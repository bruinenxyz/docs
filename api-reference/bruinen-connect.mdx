description: "Streamline user account authentication with our managed UI."

Bruinen Connect is an in-site script used to manage user account authentication directly without the need for you to write any custom code.
Connect provides a managed UI to allow: 

* You to request access to user accounts
* Users to grant permission for you to use data from already-authenticated sources
* Users to view and manage authenticated sources directly in your application

When using Bruinen Connect, you will not need to build a custom UI to handle account authentication or manage the complexities of redirecting users to source-specific authentication URLs.

## Setting up Connect

To install Bruinen Connect, add the following tag to your HTML header:

```html
<script src="script.bruinen.xyz/script.js" />
```

Once installed, initialize Connect:

```typescript
window.bruinenInit({
    clientID: string; // Required
    clientUserToken: string; // User auth token from Bruinen (optional)
    sources: Array<Source>; // List of sources to link with
    requiredSources: Array<Source>; // List of sources that are required
    onSourceConnectionSuccess: Function; // Callback called when a new source is successfully linked
});
```

On initialization, you can optionally pass a `clientUserToken`, which can be generated via the `/auth/:userId` endpoint or using the SDK:

```typescript
const clientUserToken = bruinenSDK.getUserAuthToken(email);
```

If this token is passed, Bruinen will use it to pre-fill any permissions already granted to you by the user.
Note that this method can only be called using your secret and will fail if initiated from the browser-side SDK.

The `onSourceConnectionRequest` callback should accept `accountID` as a parameter so that the authenticated account can be identified and used in the callback.

## Using Connect

```typescript
{
    // Opens the modal
    function openConnect(): void

    // Forces the modal to close (e.g., if the user navigates away from page)
    function closeConnect(): void
}
```
