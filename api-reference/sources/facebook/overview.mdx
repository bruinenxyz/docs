The Facebook source provides access to the user's profile, posts, photos, and more.

Facebook uses your client ID and secret to authenticate your API â€” to add your client ID to use Facebook via Bruinen, please reach out to support@bruinen.co.
Note that the `/friends` endpoint will only return other friends that have also authenticated the client ID used for access, instead of all of the user's friends.
