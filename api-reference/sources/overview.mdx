Sources represent external companies or APIs that hold valuable parts of a user's identity.
Each source defines the location of a user profile, how to interact with said profile, and what data is available.
Sources all follow similar patterns and are available via SDK and API. 

To access user data from a source, you will need to pass the `accountId` of a user account that you have permission to view.

## Metadata

All sources provide metadata to help you quickly and easily display information to your users.
It provides user-friendly names, descriptions, icons, and colors specific to each source.
Metadata is available at `/sources/{source_name}/metadata`.

Fields are also annotated.
You can use the `fields` field to decide how best to display that data to your user:

```typescript
{
  prominent: boolean // If this field is generally user-visible
  friendlyName: string // User-facing name for the field (ex: Username)
  description: string // User-facing description for the field (ex: Your Twitter handle)
  sensitive: boolean // If this field should not be displayed to anyone but the user (ex: email)
}
```

Example source metadata is displayed below:

```json
{
  friendlyName: "Twitter",
  description: "The internet's notice board, show us your best tweets",
  name: "twitter",
  icon: "https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/twitter/twitter-icon.svg",
  color: ["#1DA1F2"],
  methods: [
    {
      method: "getProfile",
      route: "profile",
      friendlyName: "Profile",
      description: "Your basic twitter profile",
    },
    {
      method: "getTweets",
      route: "tweets",
      friendlyName: "Tweets",
      description: "Your latest tweets",
      fields: {
        text: {
          prominent: true,
          friendlyName: "Tweet",
          description: "A tweet",
        },
        id: {
          prominent: false,
          friendlyName: "ID of the tweet",
          description: "The ID of the tweet",
        },
    },
    {
      method: "getFollowers",
      route: "followers",
      friendlyName: "Followers",
      description: "Your followers",
    },
    {
      method: "getLikedTweets",
      route: "likedTweets",
      friendlyName: "Liked Tweets",
      description: "Your liked tweets",
    },
    {
      method: "getMentionTweets",
      route: "mentionTweets",
      friendlyName: "Mention Tweets",
      description: "Your mention tweets",
    }
  ]
}
```
